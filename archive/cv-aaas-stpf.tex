  %developed a postdoctoral fellowship training proposal as a NIH F32 NRSA
  %application. The proposal integrated computational modeling with spatial
  %navigation experiments based on behavioral data from position-tracking sensors
  %and neural data from multiregional hippocampal--entorhinal single-unit ensemble
  %recordings. The application received a 21st percentile rank; I followed up the

  %resulted from a collaboration with David J. Foster (now at UC Berkeley) that

  %reactivation data. By integrating Prof.~Zhang’s mathematical theories of
  %spatial cognitive maps, I wrote and submitted a proposal for a \$200K/2-year
  %project to the JHU Science of Learning Institute. The proposal was awarded at
  %the \$150K level and research outcomes included (1) novel theories of temporal
  %synchronization coding that inspired the 2017 NSF proposal effort, and (2)
  %preliminary dynamical models of sharp-wave reactivation that provided the

  %40-page research narrative, including writing, editing, and/or integrating
  %each lab’s contributions and worked with ORA to submit the proposal. While

  %on p.\pageref{sec:funding}) was the result of 6 months of collaboration,
  %brain-storming, and team-building between the Zhang lab at JHU/SOM and a group
  %of JHUAPL engineers, mathematicians, and scientists. The project was initially
  %inspired by results that I presented at my Society for Neuroscience 2017 meeting
  %poster. I wrote Aim 1 and integrated the full research narrative with inputs
  %from our collaborators for the proposal of this \$997K/2-year project to develop
  %those initial ideas into technological applications (e.g., robotics, autonomous
  %control, AI) that reciprocally inform neuroscience. The project has so far
  %produced three posters, a conference talk \& proceedings publication, three
  %patent applications, a preprint, a research article in Biological Cybernetics, a

  %(UC Berkeley) on the basis of the internal SLI award (see above), I wrote

  %This proposal was awarded (2018--2020; see \emph{\nameref{sec:funding}} on
