\vspace{.3in}

\subsection*{Duties --- HSA/Program Officer}
\label{sec:duties}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] \emph{Perform scientific and administrative reviews and analyses of
    applications/proposals from a programmatic viewpoint.}
\end{itemize}

In 2021, I contributed to the programmatic development of a competitive NSF EFRI
program topic. In 2022, I served on the preliminary and final review panels
for that EFRI topic and as an ad-hoc reviewer for the NSF CAREER program. From
2016--2021, I served three times on the Review Committee for the Computational
Systems Neuroscience (Cosyne) conference. \cf{service}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] \emph{Consult with and advise grantees/contractors during preparation
    of applications/proposals and provide guidance on program issues.}
\end{itemize}

From 2018--2022, I met with various program directors from the Navy (ONR) and
the NSF to receive advice on the preparation of applications and discussed in
detail how to maximize program relevance. Based on this experience, I wrote or
co-wrote and submitted a number of whitepapers and grant applications at various
levels of project size and budget. Through these discussions and the subsequent
development and programmatic review of my submitted applications, I gained
substantial knowledge of the role of program officers in guiding investigators
as they develop applications so as to align with mission criteria and funding
priorities of the agency. \cf{resprogram}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] \emph{Develop, coordinate and administer grants, cooperative
      agreements, and contracts established to fulfill the mission of the Branch and
    Division.}
\end{itemize}

In 2014, I worked with program directors and technical staff at IARPA as an
outside consultant and contributed intellectually to the development of RFIs and
solicitations at that agency. \cf{service}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] \emph{Visit universities, research institutions, commercial
      organizations, other government agencies, entrepreneur/innovation centers, and
      public and private organizations to promote and explain the objectives of the
    program.}
\end{itemize}

Since 2009, I have delivered numerous seminars and invited lectures at various
top research universities---e.g., the University of Minnesota in 2020 and
the University of Toronto in 2022---and public organizations---e.g., the
Neuromatch Conference series from 2020--2021 and the US Air Force Research
Laboratory (AFRL) in 2022---at the national and international levels to promote
and explain the objectives and findings of my research program. \cf{talks}.

Furthermore, I have visited extensively with private commercial innovation
centers including the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
(JHUAPL)~\see{press} for collaborative efforts to develop federal funding
applications and manage the resulting cross-divisional research, outreach, and
educational projects. \cfcf{resprogram}{eduprogram}. My extensive experience
in persuasive presentation of scientific concepts, objectives, and findings
to varied academic, commercial, and learner groups will directly translate to
communication and outreach of extramural program objectives.

\subsection*{Basic Experience Requirements}
\label{sec:basicreqs}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] \emph{Demonstrated independence in planning, organizing, and
conducting biomedical behavioral health-related research.}
  \item[-] \emph{Served effectively, in research program administration and
acquired an understanding of the history, interests, internal dynamics, and
relationships of organizations in which health research is conducted.}
\end{itemize}

%This experience may be gained as a principal investigator of a grant or
%contract, or may otherwise be gained through active involvement in initiating
%research projects, developing protocols, conducting studies, documenting
%findings, interpreting results in a published report (journal), supervising
%staff, and managing the budget.

From 2019--2022, as Research Associate faculty in the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine (JHU/SOM)~\see{job1}, I served as principal investigator
(or co-PI) of multiple federal grant-awarded projects that I initiated
independently, including a NIH/NINDS R03 award and a NSF/NCS FOUNDATIONS
award, which is part of the US BRAIN Initiative. These projects investigated,
respectively, physiological mechanisms underlying cognitive mapping and episodic
memory formation, and theoretical advances in the understanding of neural
oscillations as a basis of self-organizing spatiotemporal activity patterns
in brains. \cf{funding}. During that time, I also independently initiated new
collaborations and planned and developed several other research projects,
leading to a cross-disciplinary NSF application in 2020 and an internal JHU
application in 2022. \cf{resprogram}.

To manage these projects, I developed protocols including reference
computational models, conducted data analyses, supervised and mentored graduate
students and junior staff~\see{mentoring}, and administered the grants by
coordinating with JHU administrators, integrating and writing progress reports
for the agencies, applying for no-cost extensions, and depositing published
papers in agency-hosted archives such as the NSF Public Access Repository. The
following peer-reviewed publications resulted from these projects:
%
\begin{quote}
  • Hadzic, Hwang, Zhang, Schultz, Monaco (2022) \emph{Array}. \\
  • Buckley, Monaco, Schultz, Chalmers, Hadzic, Zhang (2022) In: IEEE
  Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC'22). \\
  • Schultz, Villafañe-Delgado, Reilly, Saksena, Hwang (2022) In: Emergent
  Behavior in System of Systems Engineering. \\
  • Hwang, Schultz, Monaco, Zhang (2021) \emph{JHUAPL Technical Digest}. \\ 
  • Monaco, Hwang, Schultz, Zhang (2020) \emph{Biological Cybernetics}. \\ 
  • Monaco, Hwang, Schultz, Zhang (2019) In: International Society for
  Photonics (SPIE'19). \\
\end{quote}
%
\cf{pubs} for complete publication details, including two additional
pending publications in review or revision stages. The first author
(Hadzic) of the first paper above was a JHUAPL junior staff member whom I
mentored~\see{mentoring}.

From 2016--2018, as a JHU/SOM Postdoctoral Fellow~\see{job2}, I independently
initiated collaborations and research projects resulting in an internal
JHU Science of Learning Institute award~\see{previnternalsupport} and the
development and submission of two external (NIH and NSF) applications that
were awarded starting FY19. \cfcf{funding}{resprogram}. In that time, I
additionally conceived and coordinated a large collaborative project proposal
among 8 labs across JHU that was selectively funded by DARPA/BTO and targeted
noninvasive stimulation of neuroplasticity for health-related interventions and
augmentation~\see{genc}.

From 2014--2016, I conducted a computational modeling and neural data analysis
study in which I developed neural coding protocols, documented my findings, and
interpreted the results in a substantial original research article integrating
multiple convergent methodological approaches that I carried from preprint to
high-impact publication:

\begin{quote}
  • Monaco, De Guzman, Blair, Zhang (2019) \emph{PLOS Computational Biology}. \\ 
  • Monaco, Blair, Zhang (2017) \emph{bioRxiv}. \\ 
\end{quote}
%
\cf{pubs} for complete publication details. This 2019 publication laid the
theoretical and experimental groundwork for establishing my collaboration with
JHUAPL, the resultant NSF-awarded project~\see{funding}, my co-organization
of and participation in a well-attended NIH BRAIN Investigators symposium in
2020~\see{symposium}, and my interactions with NSF program directors that led
to my extramural contributions to the programmatic development and review of a
competitively funded NSF EFRI topic from 2020--2022~\see{programsvc}.

From 2009--2014, as a JHU Mind/Brain Institute (JHU/MBI) Postdoctoral
Fellow~\see{job3}, I conducted a statistical modeling study of neurobehavioral
datasets and developed protocols for behavioral quantification of rats
performing spatial navigation experiments. My study provided the first evidence
for mammalian long-term memory formation tied to individual behaviors (i.e.,
lateral head-scanning movements). In collaboration with my postdoctoral lab, I
interpreted and published my findings in high-impact journals:

\begin{quote}
  • Monaco, Rao, Roth, Knierim (2014) \emph{Nature Neuroscience}. \\ 
  • Wang, Monaco, Knierim (2020) \emph{Current Biology}. \\ 
\end{quote}
%
\cf{pubs} for complete publication details. The first author (Wang) of the
second paper above was a graduate student whom I mentored~\see{mentoring}.
My head-scanning study provided the basis for my 2010 application and 2011
resubmission of a NIH NRSA Postdoctoral Fellowship (F32)~\see{nrsa}, as guided
by discussions that I initiated with NINDS PO Jim Gnadt.

In summary, from 2010 to the present, I have developed, executed, and
administered an independent, growing program in health-related preclinical
neuroscience and neural data science research. This programmatic evolution
relied on manifold extended interactions with program officers at various
federal funding agencies. Through this experience, I have gained a substantial
understanding of the history, interests, internal dynamics, and relationships
within and between funding organizations, and of the public service performed by
program officers.


\subsection*{Requirements for the GS-12 Level}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] \emph{One year of independent health research beyond the doctoral
degree and one year of health research program administration.}
\end{itemize}
 
As described above under \textcolor{hopkinsblue}{\emph{\nameref{sec:basicreqs}}}
and below under \textcolor{hopkinsblue}{\emph{\nameref{sec:resprogram}}},
I have three years of Research Associate faculty experience developing
and administering an independent cross-divisional and interdisciplinary
research program~\see{job1}, five years of postdoctoral experience performing
preclinical health-related neuroscience research~\see{job2}, and five years of
postdoctoral experience in statistical neurobehavioral modeling and neural data
science~\see{job3}. 

In particular, I have$\ldots$
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item[•] Served as principal investigator or equivalent on competitively
    awarded grants from 2016--2021: \cf{funding};
  \item[•] Independently developed research projects, and demonstrated
    primary authorship of five original peer-reviewed research publications
    from 2011--present, including in top journals like Nature Neuroscience:
    \cfcf{resprogram}{pubs}; and
  \item[•] Held a faculty research position in Biomedical Engineering from
    2019--2022: \cf{job1}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Requirements for the GS-13 Level}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] \emph{Managed significant independent research projects}.
    \itemnote{\cfcf{basicreqs}{resprogram}.}
  \item[-] \emph{Supervised graduate researchers and junior technical staff}.
    \itemnote{\cf{mentoring}.}
  \item[-] \emph{Published in refereed journals}. \itemnote{\cf{pubs}.}
  \item[-] \emph{Presented published work to scientific organizations}.
    \itemnote{\cfcf{talks}{presentations}.}
  \item[-] \emph{Served as a reviewer on peer-review panels and journals}.
    \itemnote{\cfcf{service}{programsvc}.}
  \item[-] \emph{Held the position of Assistant or Associate Professor or
      equivalent}. \itemnote{\cf{cv} and the above-linked sections to assess the
        depth and breadth of my academic credentials. Note that, as of 2019, the
        JHU/SOM Provost for Postdoctoral Affairs evaluated my C.V. as being equivalent
        to a mid-tenure-track Assistant Professor, i.e., approximately 3 years from
        tenure and promotion to Associate Professor rank. Given my experience accrued
        in the three years since that evaluation, I would estimate that my position as
        of 2022 should be fairly judged as equivalent to a recently tenured Associate
      Professor.}
  \end{itemize}

My professional experience in the academic environment of the JHU/SOM Department
of Biomedical Engineering has involved each of the listed requirements
above, particularly with respect to the Research Asssociate faculty position
that I held from 2019--2022~\see{job1}. The summaries above starting with
\cfonly{basicreqs} provide additional context, and the linked sections indicated
next to the arrows under each requirement provide further supporting details.


\subsection*{Requirements for the GS-14 Level}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[-] \emph{At least one year of professional experience that demonstrates
      extensive scientific expertise incorporating research experience with
      varied responsibilities for providing leadership in a scientific area, and
      functioning as a leader for a variety of efforts, such as directing research
      and coordinating committee and teaching activities, and organizing and
    chairing sessions at national scientific meetings.}
  \item[-] \emph{Served as an appointed member of a scientific peer-review panel
    or editorial board.} \itemnote{\cf{programsvc}.}
  \item[-] \emph{Held the position of Associate Professor, Professor or
      equivalent.} \itemnote{\cf{cv} and also my note under the last listed
      requirement for the GS-13 level above.}
\end{itemize}

I have three years of professional experience as a Research Associate~\see{job1}
and five years of experience as a Postdoctoral Fellow~\see{job2} in which
I employed my extensive research experience-based scientific expertise to
undertake responsibilities for my independently developed portfolio of
leadership efforts in computational and theoretical neuroscience and related
subfields of control theory, autonomous systems, embodied cognition, and
artificial intelligence. While these leadership efforts have been
described above in response to other duties and requirements, they are also
detailed in \cfonly{resprogram}, \cfonly{service}, \cfonly{presentations}, and
\cfonly{eduprogram}. Recognition of some of these efforts---including \emph{Fast
Company} magazine ranking JHUAPL as the \#3 ``Most Innovative Workplace''
based on my NSF-funded project---is detailed under \cfonly{recognition}.

Selected examples of my research-based scientific leadership efforts include the
following:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Directed research conducted by my student mentees~\see{mentoring}
    and key personnel or co-investigators on my funded research

    and the NSF~\see{programsvc}.}
  \item Analyze trends and new scientific fields to assess the adequacy of
    research being conducted and proposed in a given area.
    \itemnote{My education was grounded in mathematics and
      philosophy~\see{education}, which has allowed me to build methods that I use
      in my research from scratch and to assess their inferential utility, e.g.,
      with respect to statistical validity, etc. As I developed my independent
      research program~\see{resprogram}, I gained substantial experience
      evaluating current trends in methods, approaches, and scientific questions
    in current and emerging fields.}
  \item Identify and recommend the program direction of new research.
    \itemnote{In nearly 23 years of experience in neuroscience
      research~\see{education}~\see{pubs}~\see{resprogram}, I have developed deep
      intuitions and agility in recognizing and evaluating new lines of research.
      My interdisciplinary projects have allowed me to make distinctions between
      approaches make good-faith recommendations on the potential strengths of new
    research.}
  \item Identify gaps in scientific research.
    \itemnote{As described for the previous two items, my interdisciplinary
      research and long history in neuroscience~\see{education}~\see{pubs} and
      related fields has informed my ability to assess the current state of the
      science. In particular, my theoretical interests inform how I survey for
    epistemic gaps based on processes of inductive reasoning.}
  \item Manage the development of organizational or research group policies in
    response to changes in levels of funding or legislative/program changes.
    \itemnote{Based on my extended history of interactions with program officers
      as described above in \cfonly{duties} and \cfonly{basicreqs}, I have extensive
      familiarity with organizational policies and requirements at funding agencies in
    response to funding level changes due to legislation or other factors.}
  \item Monitor scientific progress of research or clinical programs to assure
    that objectives are met.
    \itemnote{Given my experience, particularly as JHU/SOM Research
      Associate~\see{job1}, I have had to continually monitor scientific progress in
      internally and externally funded research projects at varied levels of budget
      and scope, e.g., for small team projects like my JHU/SLI award~\see{sli} and larger
    projects like my NSF award~\see{nsf}.}
  \item Provide guidance or interpret regulations and funding policies regarding
    biomedical, behavioral health, or health-related research.
    \itemnote{As described above under \cfonly{duties}, my extensive

      informed my ability to assess and interpret policy effects for health-releated
    research.}
  \item To verify your level of experience for the previous seven (7) questions,
    please list the name, email address, and phone number of someone who we can
    contact to get more information.
    \itemnote{Prof. Knierim was my postdoctoral supervisor from
      2009--2014~\see{job3}, and he is familiar and up-to-date with my current
    levels of experience and expertise.}
  \item Administer unsolicited grant/contract proposals and provide support
    regarding funding options and areas of program emphasis.
    \itemnote{As described above under \cfonly{duties} and below under
      \cfonly{programsvc}, my extensive interactions with program officers and my
      service on merit-review panels has given me substantial knowledge about the
      processes involved in unsolicited proposals and has informed my ability to
    support funding options aligned with program priorities.}
  \item Appoint and manage grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements review
    panels.
    \itemnote{My participation on multiple federal merit-review
      panels~\see{programsvc}---in addition to observing the processes that my spouse
      (see note for item \#27 below) goes through to do these tasks as a federal
      funding agency program officer---has given me substantive exposure to grants
      administration processes related to the logistics of appointing panels for
      these purposes. This exposure has provided me knowledge that will
    translate to performance of these tasks.}
  \item Evaluate the technical and scientific merit of funding applications and
    proposals being submitted for approval.
    \itemnote{My extensive background in health-related research and scientific
      review based in the highly contentious and multidisciplinary field of

      world-class preparation for evaluating the technical and scientific merit of
    funding applications.}
  \item Review applications for funding created by others to ensure they have
    been prepared properly.
    \itemnote{I have prepared numerous funding applications and grant proposals
      intended for various funding agencies~\see{funding}~\see{resprogram}, which has
      given me substantial real-world experience and knowledge regarding the proper
    preparation of funding applications.}
  \item Recommend and distribute research funding for new research
    initiatives/efforts.
    \itemnote{My knowledge and familiarity with the processes of recommending
      and distributing research funding derive from my interactions with program
      officers as recommendations are being finalized~\see{funding} and from
      observing my spouse (see note for item \#27 below) perform this role at the
    level of federal funding agencies.}
  \item Manage research fund distribution amongst competing interests within an
    organization.
    \itemnote{\emph{ibid.}}
  \item Obtain independent grant funding for research from either the private or
    public sector.
    \itemnote{I have successfully obtained independent research funding from
      public sector agencies~\see{funding} and have submitted several applications to
    private foundations.}
  \item Write or co-write research grants.

  I initiated to conduct modeling studies informed by his lab’s hippocampal
  reactivation data. By integrating Prof.~Zhang’s mathematical theories of
  spatial cognitive maps, I wrote and submitted a proposal for a \$200K/2-year
  project to the JHU Science of Learning Institute. The proposal was awarded at
  the \$150K level and research outcomes included (1) novel theories of temporal
  synchronization coding that inspired the 2017 NSF proposal effort, and (2)
  preliminary dynamical models of sharp-wave reactivation that provided the
foundation for the 2018 NIH R03 award.}

  experimental labs from JHU/MBI and coordinated proposed contributions to
  maximize scientific impact with a budget of \$9.8M/5 years. I coordinated the
  40-page research narrative, including writing, editing, and/or integrating
  each lab’s contributions and worked with ORA to submit the proposal. While

  brain-storming, and team-building between the Zhang lab at JHU/SOM and a group
  of JHUAPL engineers, mathematicians, and scientists. The project was initially
  inspired by results that I presented at my Society for Neuroscience 2017 meeting
  poster. I wrote Aim 1 and integrated the full research narrative with inputs
  from our collaborators for the proposal of this \$997K/2-year project to develop
  those initial ideas into technological applications (e.g., robotics, autonomous
  control, AI) that reciprocally inform neuroscience. The project has so far
  produced three posters, a conference talk \& proceedings publication, three
  patent applications, a preprint, a research article in Biological Cybernetics, a
  NIH BRAIN Investigators Meeting symposium talk, and a substantial STEM program.
  We received a no-cost extension through FY21 to complete the final phase of the

{NCS-FO: Neuroeconomics as a biomimetic control theory for mobile robotic
decision making}
{This FY21 proposal was submitted to the NSF/NCS FOUNDATIONS program; while
  it was discussed and received high scores, the application was declined. I
  co-developed this project in collaboration with colleagues at the University of
  Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), JHU Whiting School of Engineering (JHU/WSE),
  and JHUAPL. Our interdisciplinary project brought together multiscale human
  electrophysiological recordings (UPMC), latent state-space models (JHU/WSE),
  control- and game-theoretic analysis (JHUAPL), and mechanistic neural models
  (JHU/BME, for which I would have been co-PI). We proposed to investigate and
  characterize the neural bases of metacognitive brain states that influence
  decision-making during social \& economic games. As a high-risk/high-reward
  element, we proposed to algorithmicize our results to advance human-robot
interaction.}

{Grant Proposal (JHU/Discovery Award) }
{Algorithms of flexible navigation in mice and robots}
{This intramural FY23 proposal for a JHU Discovery Award resulted from a new
  collaboration with Patricia Janak (PI; JHU/PBS) and Céline Drieu (postdoctoral
  fellow), in which we seek to integrate advanced large-scale neural recording
  technologies with my theoretical modeling of neural systems as a distributed
  control problem. Fundamental questions of neural systems communication will
  be addressed using convergent data-driven and theory-driven approaches
  to understanding the cognitive dynamics that enable mice to perform spatial
goal-directed memory tasks.}

  2018--2021 \hspace{0.1in} & The NSF project (see
  \emph{\nameref{sec:funding}} on p.\pageref{sec:funding}) was
  successfully funded with a substantial STEM component for high-school students
  involving the development of both a 12-week course and an intense 2-day
  seminar called ``Swarming Powered by Neuroscience.'' I worked with our STEM
  education collaborators at JHUAPL to develop computational resources required
  for the curricula. Additionally, I participated in and delivered two zoom
  lectures about our research for the virtual 4-day STEM workshop (developed due
  to Covid requirements) with 40+ students that was held in January 2021.
