\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Manage program workloads and ensure timely completion of project
milestones.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role supporting the NIH BRAIN
Initiative, I have managed multiple complex workstreams including policy
implementation, workshop organization, strategic planning, and cross-team
coordination. \cf{jobobd}. A key example is my leadership of the BRAIN
NeuroAI Workshop planning process in 2024 (1 year), where I successfully
coordinated internal NIH and external scientific planning committees, secured
authorizations, and executed a major two-day event despite budget constraints
and logistical obstacles, resulting in participation from nearly 2,000 attendees
(200 in-person) from 48 countries.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Direct research activities to maintain focus on programmatic
goals.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), I have provided strategic direction for multiple
BRAIN research programs~\see{jobobd}, ensuring alignment with BRAIN Initiative
priorities in data science, theory, and computational modeling. For example, I
led development of new data sharing workflows that improved efficiency while
maintaining rigorous standards. In addition, I am currently working to guide the
post-workshop NeuroAI strategic planning porcess across BRAIN Teams and working
groups to establish research priorities advancing BRAIN's mission over the next
decade.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Coordinate with leadership to obtain and allocate necessary
program resources.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role~\see{jobobd}, I regularly
advise the BRAIN Director on scientific and technological priorities, supporting
decision-making through analysis and recommendations that guide decisions around
program resource allocations. For example, my implementation strategy for
BRAIN's data management and sharing policy avoided unnecessary expenditures for
up-front development costs which may have otherwise exceeded \$500,000, while
still achieving policy objectives. In 2024, I successfully secured resources for
the BRAIN NeuroAI Workshop held in November despite FY24 budget constraints.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Review grant applications and analyze proposals from program
perspective.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role~\see{jobobd}, I have served as
a subject matter expert (SME) for multiple BRAIN Teams, providing scientific
and programmatic review of grant applications for funding opportunities related
to computational neuroscience, theoretical neuroscience, systems neuroscience,
neuromorphic computing, software tools, and data science. I developed reference
language for new funding opportunities (NOFOs) developed by BRAIN Teams and
established improved workflows for program staff to evaluate research proposals
and data management and sharing (DMS) plans. In 2024, I also contributed ad-hoc
reviews of funding applications for the Air Force Office of Sponsored Research
(AFOSR). \cf{service}.

In 2021 and 2022 (2 years), before joining the NIH, I contributed to the
development of a competitive National Science Foundation (NSF) EFRI program
topic, served on several review panels for the successfully adopted EFRI topic,
and provided ad-hoc reviews for the NSF CAREER program. \cf{programsvc}.

Several times from 2016 to 2024 (4 years total), I provided review service
for scientific conferences. In 2024, I contributed ad-hoc reviews of paper
submissions for the Neuro-Inspired Computational Elements (NICE) Conference.
From 2016 to 2021, I served three times on the Review Committee for the
Computational Systems Neuroscience (Cosyne) conference. \cf{confsvc}.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Guide applicants and grantees on program requirements, policies,
and opportunities.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role~\see{jobobd}, I have
provided guidance to investigators on grant applications, data sharing policy
expectations and requirements, and program priorities across multiple BRAIN
portfolios. Additionally, I created and implemented new standard operating
procedures that streamlined communications between program staff and applicants,
reducing overall burden while maintaining high standards for maximizing the
scientific impact of NIH and BRAIN data sharing.

From 2018 to 2022 (5 years), before joining the NIH, I met with various
program directors from the Navy (Office of Naval Research) and the NSF (ENG,
CISE) to discuss how to maximize program relevance of applications that I was
preparing. From this experience, I wrote or co-wrote and submitted a number of
whitepapers and grant applications at various levels of project size and budget.
\cf{res}. Through these discussions and the subsequent development and
programmatic review of my submitted applications, I gained substantial and
varied knowledge of the role of program officers in guiding investigators as
they develop applications to align with mission criteria and program priorities.


\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Develop and manage grants and cooperative agreements supporting
program mission and objectives.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role~\see{jobobd}, I have worked
closely with multiple BRAIN Teams to support development and coordination of
cooperative agreements and research awards, providing SME programmatic reviews
during pre- and post-award phases. I have served as a resource for program
teams to ensure alignment of milestones with the DMS policy expectations of
NIH and the BRAIN Initiative. In addition, my contributions include providing
program staff on data sharing requirements for new awards, participating in
BRAIN consortium network meetings like BICAN and CONNECTS, and helping evaluate
milestone progress for complex cooperative agreements to verify continued
alignment with BRAIN objectives.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Organize scientific workshops and conferences to advance program goals.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role in the Office of the BRAIN
Director (OBD)~\see{jobobd}, I have demonstrated extensive experience planning
and executing scientific meetings at multiple scales, from co-organizing
focused sessions to leading major workshops. I co-organized the ``Embodied
NeuroAI'' specialty session at the recent BRAIN Initiative Conference (June
2024)~\see{natltalks} and a panel discussion on the future sustainability of the
BRAIN data ecosystem for the INCF Assembly (September 2024)~\see{intltalks}. My
leadership of the BRAIN NeuroAI Workshop planning efforts showcased my ability
to manage complex engagements, including coordinating with logistics contractors
for attendee registration, 508c compliance, venue arrangements, managing hybrid
participation platforms, and organizing an early-career poster competition to
ensure a successful workshop.

From 2019 to 2020 (1 year), prior to joining the NIH, I co-organized a
scientific symposium that took place (virtually) at the 2020 BRAIN Initiative
Investigators Meeting~\see{symposium}. This symposium brought together a panel
of 5 leading researchers, including me, to explore key relationships between
machine learning and dynamical systems neuroscience that are critical to
advancing BRAIN's program objectives relating to theory, modeling, and data
analysis.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Visit universities and attend conferences to conduct program
outreach to diverse audiences.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role~\see{jobobd}, I have
regularly represented the NIH BRAIN Initiative at major scientific
conferences and workshops, including recent international presentations at
NeurIPS, SfN, INCF Assembly, IEEE/ACM ICONS, and the Telluride Neuromorphic
Workshop~\see{intltalks}. My outreach activities have built crucial
relationships with academic, commercial, and government partners, exemplified by
my coordination with the Allen Institute, MIT, and other major BRAIN-supported
research centers.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Communicate complex scientific topics effectively to a variety of
national audiences.}
\end{itemize}

Since 2010 (14 years), across my career, I have had extensive experience
communicating scientific concepts through diverse channels at national
and international venues, ranging from delivering research talks at
major conferences to participating in policy-focused panel discussions.
\cfcf{talks}{comms}. Recent examples include recording an interview about
theoretical neuroscience and the BRAIN NeuroAI Workshop for the popular
Brain-Inspired Podcast~\see{media}, drafting blog posts for the BRAIN Blog,
developing internal communications and reports about BRAIN Initiative efforts
and priorities, and leading technical and policy-oriented discussions
across scientific domains including neuroscience, AI, informatics, data
science, and neuromorphic computing. 

Since 2010 (14 years), I delivered numerous scientific seminars and invited
lectures~\see{talks} at top research universities---e.g., the University
of Minnesota in 2020 and the University of Toronto in 2022---and public
organizations---e.g., the Neuromatch Conference series from 2020--2021 and
the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in 2022 and 2023---to communicate
scientific findings and perspectives from my research.

From 2018 to 2021 (4 years), prior to joining the NIH, I collaborated
extensively with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
(JHUAPL) on efforts to develop federal funding applications, manage the
resulting awards, and execute the projects by leading a cross-divisional team
to conduct research, publish findings, disseminate outreach materials, and
contribute to educational components. \cfcf{res}{eduprogram}.

My ability to effectively communicate complex topics to varied audiences is
demonstrated through a long history of invited presentations and successful
collaborations at universities, research centers, workshops, conferences,
panels, podcasts, and seminars.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Develop policies advancing scientific programs of national
importance related to health.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role~\see{jobobd}, I have led
development and implementation of policies that advance BRAIN's mission,
including data management and sharing requirements that promote open science.
I currently guide strategic planning efforts to establish BRAIN as a leader in
NeuroAI research, working to develop partnerships with other agencies to shape
priorities and policies that will guide the future of neuroscience research and
neurotechnologies critical to brain health.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Support program leadership by serving as liaison to teams of
extramural program officers and staff.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role~\see{jobobd}, I have served
as Office of the BRAIN Director liaison to multiple BRAIN Teams and working
groups, including the BRAIN NeuroAI Working Group which I formed in late
2023 and for which I have since served as co-lead. As a team liaison, I have
coordinated activities between program staff, project scientists, intramural
consultants, and leadership, including division directors and branch chiefs
across multiple BRAIN-participating ICs. My accomplishments in developing
DMS policy implementations across BRAIN programs and portfolios demonstrate
my ability to orchestrate complex workflows across diverse roles, resulting
in improved efficiency and reduced burden. 

Since January 2023 (2 years), in addition, I have served as a BRAIN liaison
or representative on trans-NIH working groups (for example, consciousness
research), special interest groups (for example, AI), program (for example,
the NIH Common Fund, including the recently launched Complement-ARIE program),
and the NSF--NIH Smart and Connected Health (SCH) program's cofunding
office team. My contributions to these trans-NIH initiatives include SME
review, implementation planning, concept development, and serving as the
scientific/research contact of record on published NSF and NIH funding
solicitations.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Build working relationships with leading scientists by engaging
through conferences and outreach.}
\end{itemize}

In my current role~\see{jobobd}, I have maintained extensive engagement with
the scientific community through conference participation, site visits, and

\subsubsection*{A. Direct/Independent Research Qualifying Experience}

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Managed diverse scientific health-related research programs with
national and international impact.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role supporting the NIH BRAIN
Director, I have supported and contributed to multiple high-impact research
programs focused on whole-brain cell atlasing, circuits/systems neuroscience,
artificial intelligence, ccomputational modeling, theory, open data standards,
and reproducible analytics workflows. \cf{jobobd}. I worked across BRAIN Teams
and led initiatives spanning multiple NIH institutes, including managing the
launch of a new team focused on data sharing and informatics programs, creating
and leading a new working group focused on new opportunities at the intersection
of neuroscience and AI (``NeuroAI''), and leading the planning efforts for the
BRAIN NeuroAI Workshop that took place on November 12 and 13, 2024. The BRAIN
NeuroAI Workshop was a 2-day hybrid event that was attended in-person (200)
or virtually (1,749) by almost 2,000 participants from 48 countries. Through
these efforts, I built collaborative networks across key academic researchers,
commercial partners from startups to the top tech companies, and government
agencies (NIH, ARPA-H, NSF, DOE, DOD), demonstrating my ability to manage
diverse research programs, coordinate crucial outreach, and build the key
relationships needed to enable transformative national and international impact.

From 2019 to 2022 (3 years), as Research Associate faculty in the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHU/SOM)~\see{job1}, I served as
principal investigator (or co-PI) of multiple federal grant-awarded projects
that I initiated independently, including a NIH/NINDS R03 award and a NSF/NCS
FOUNDATIONS award, part of the NSF's BRAIN Initiative portfolio. In these
projects, I build computational tools and co-developed cross-disciplinary
mathematical frameworks to address physiological mechanisms underlying
cognitive mapping and episodic memory formation, theoretical advances in
the understanding of neural oscillations as a basis of self-organizing
spatiotemporal activity patterns in brains, and established approaches to
translating theoretical advances to early-stage technological applications,
including multi-agent robotic metacontroller models. \cf{funding}. During that
time, I also independently initiated new collaborations and developed several
other research projects, leading to an inter-disciplinary NSF application in 2020
and an internal JHU application in 2022. \cf{res}.

To manage the above projects (2019--2022, 3 years), I developed protocols
including reference computational models, conducted data analyses, supervised
and mentored graduate students and junior staff~\see{mentoring}, and
administered the grants by coordinating with JHU administrators, integrating and
writing progress reports for funding agencies, applying for no-cost extensions,
and depositing published papers in agency-hosted archives such as the NSF Public
Access Repository. At least six (6) peer-reviewed publications resulted from
these collaborative, cross-divisional projects. \cf{hadzicpub}.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Developed strategic plans for resource allocation across competing
research programs.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role~\see{jobobd}, I have developed
new priority areas for strategic planning initiatives within the BRAIN
Initiative, including a new vision for a sustainable BRAIN data ecosystem.
At the same time, I have implemented and refined the recently established
data management and sharing (DMS) policies that mandate research data sharing
across the NIH and BRAIN. My DMS workflows have improved program efficiency
while reducing costs. I advised the BRAIN Director on resource allocation
decisions across multiple research programs and helped establish criteria for
evaluating competing proposals. My recommendations on implementation strategies
avoided unnecessary expenditures exceeding \$500,000 while maintaining program
effectiveness.

Since February 2024 (1 year), as founder and co-lead of the BRAIN NeuroAI
Working Group~\see{jobobd}, I organized a substantial strategic planning effort
to identify innovative NeuroAI opportunities for the NIH BRAIN Initiative.
This effort was highly integrated with planning and pre-coordination of the
BRAIN NeuroAI Workshop that I co-organized with my working group in November
2024. The NeuroAI thrust is one of a small number of strategic priority areas
competitively selected by the BRAIN Director in Summer 2024 for continued
scoping and implementation. Since the workshop, I have led the integration,
synthesis, and development of the NeuroAI concept in collaboration with BRAIN
programs and teams, communicated updates to leadership, and developed critical
planning documents to harmonize workshop inputs reflecting community interest
with BRAIN mission-relevance and portfolio synergies.

From 2009 to 2022 (13 years), I was a Research Associate faculty
(3~years) developing and administering an independent cross-divisional
and interdisciplinary research program~\see{job1}; a JHU/SOM Postdoctoral
Fellow (5~years) performing preclinical health-related neuroscience
research~\see{job2}; and a JHU Postdoctoral Fellow (5~years) conducting
behavioral neuroscience and theory-driven computational modeling
research~\see{job3}. In these academic roles, I gained broad experience
developing skills for strategic planning, resource allocation, and project
management in funding-constrained, grant-driven research environments and varied
scientific and administrative contexts.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Achieved scientific distinction through research accomplishments
    and professional society membership.}
\end{itemize}

Since obtaining my Ph.D. in 2009 (15 years), I have continually worked to
establish scientific distinction through research contributions in theoretical
and computational neuroscience and adjacent fields, culminating in publications
in prestigious journals including Nature Neuroscience, Cell, PLOS Computational
Biology, Biological Cybernetics, and the Journal of Neuroscience. My work
on spatial cognition, neural computation, and theoretical neuroscience has
been recognized through invited presentations at major institutions and
conferences. Recent invitations to speak at high-profile conferences and venues
including NeurIPS, INCF Assembly, Society for Neuroscience, the BRAIN Initiative
Neuroethics Working Group (NEWG), and the Open Data in Neuroscience (ODIN)
symposium reflect my growing scientific impact. \cfcf{journalpubs}{talks}.

From 2016 to 2018 (3 years), as a JHU/SOM Postdoctoral Fellow~\see{job2}, I
independently initiated collaborations and research projects resulting in an
internal JHU Science of Learning Institute award~\see{funding}
and the development and submission of two external (NIH and NSF) applications
that were awarded starting FY19. In that time, I additionally conceived and
coordinated a large collaborative project proposal among 8~labs across JHU
that was selectively funded by DARPA/BTO and targeted noninvasive stimulation
of neuroplasticity for health-related interventions and augmentation.
\cfcf{funding}{res}

From 2009 to 2014 (5 years), as a JHU Mind/Brain Institute (JHU/MBI) Postdoctoral
Fellow~\see{job3}, I conducted a statistical modeling study of neurobehavioral
datasets and developed protocols for behavioral quantification of rats
performing spatial navigation experiments. My study provided the first evidence
for mammalian long-term memory formation tied to individual behaviors (i.e.,
lateral head-scanning movements). In collaboration with my postdoctoral lab, I
interpreted and published my findings in high-impact journals, including Nature
Neuroscience and Current Biology. \cf{journalpubs}

  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Represented organizations on committees evaluating scientific
research priorities.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role~\see{jobobd}, I have served as
an extramural SME for programmatic review on multiple BRAIN Teams evaluating
research funding applications across BRAIN programs and portfolios. I have led
working groups focused on artificial intelligence, neuromorphic engineering,
and theoretical neuroscience, culminating in organizing a major workshop that
brought together diverse research communities and stakeholders across multiple
sectors of science, technology, and health to shape future research priorities
for NeuroAI. In addition, I served on the BRAIN Initiative Conference Program
Committee in 2024 and I regularly participate in trans-NIH working groups and
represent BRAIN on program/policy implementation working groups, including for
the NIH Common Fund Complement-ARIE program and for NSF--NIH Smart Health,
for which I am the scientific/research contact of record on the published
solicitations.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Published research findings in high-impact scientific journals.}
\end{itemize}

From 2007 to 2024, I have published 14 peer-reviewed papers in leading
journals spanning computational neuroscience, cognitive science, biology, and
artificial intelligence. My work includes seminal contributions in Nature
Neuroscience, Cell, Current Biology, and PLOS Computational Biology. Recent
publications focus on theoretical advances in neurodynamical computing, Bayesian
optimization for neural control, and perspectives on computational modeling in
neurorehabilitation, demonstrating continued scientific productivity and impact.

Since January 2023 (2 years), I have developed and implemented standard
operating procedures for evaluating data management and sharing (DMS) plans
across the BRAIN Initiative. I created reference language for new funding
opportunity announcements and established workflows for program staff to review
DMS plans submitted with research proposals. My improvements to DMS evaluation
and review processes have streamlined communications between Office of the
BRAIN Director, Program Staff, applicants, and Grants Management, reducing
administrative burden while enhancing the value of rigorous DMS evaluation
standards. \cf{jobobd}.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \emph{Assessed emerging research trends to advance organizational
missions and program objectives.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), I have led efforts to evaluate and shape the
emerging field of NeuroAI within the BRAIN Initiative. Through organizing a
major workshop attended by nearly 2000 participants, I facilitated critical
discussions about integrating artificial intelligence approaches with
neuroscience research. I advised BRAIN leadership on strategic opportunities
in computational modeling, neuromorphic computing, and data-driven research,
helping establish programmatic priorities that advance NIH's mission to improve
human health through scientific discovery. \cf{jobobd}.

Prior to joining the NIH, my 2019 publication (Monaco et al., 2019, PLOS
Comput Biol)~\see{pubs} laid the theoretical and experimental groundwork
for establishing my collaboration with JHUAPL, the resultant NSF-awarded
project~\see{funding}, my co-organization of and participation in a
well-attended NIH BRAIN Investigators symposium in 2020~\see{symposium}, and
my interactions with NSF program directors that led to my initial extramural
contributions to the programmatic development and review of a competitively
funded NSF EFRI program topic (\href{https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearchResult?PIId=&PIFirstName=&PILastName=&PIOrganization=&PIState=&PIZip=&PICountry=&ProgOrganization=07040000&ProgEleCode=7633&BooleanElement=All&ProgRefCode=&BooleanRef=All&Program=&ProgOfficer=&Keyword=BRAID&AwardNumberOperator=&AwardAmount=&AwardInstrument=&ActiveAwards=true&OriginalAwardDateOperator=&StartDateOperator=&ExpDateOperator=}{\unpubtitle{BRAID}}) 
with \$30M total awarded from 2020 to 2022. \cf{programsvc}.

\begin{itemize}
  \color{hopkinsblue}
  \item \emph{Coordinated multi-agency initiatives to identify and address
research program needs.}
\end{itemize}

Since January 2023 (2 years), in my current role~\see{jobobd}, I have built
collaborative relationships across multiple federal agencies including NSF,
DOE, ARPA-H, and DOD to advance shared research priorities. I initiated the
co-funding participation of the NIH BRAIN Initiative in the joint NSF--NIH Smart
and Connected Health (SCH) program. Moreover, I contributed to internal program
discussions regarding BRAIN co-funding priorities and implementation of the
NSF--NIH CRCNS (Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience) Program.

I leveraged this experience during planning for the 2024 BRAIN NeuroAI Workshop
to both initiate and build upon potential cross-agency and cross-sector (private
foundations, investors, and tech companies) partnerships. I am currently leading
post-workshop coordination efforts to coaelesce NeuroAI initiatives across
government agencies and other stakeholders, developing shared interest to lay
the groundwork for for potential joint research investments. \cf{jobobd}.
